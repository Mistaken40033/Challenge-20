      <p>Hi! I'm Erica, a budding web developer with a passion for creating intuitive and responsive web applications. My journey into web development began with a series of comprehensive courses that equipped me with the skills and knowledge to build dynamic single-page applications using modern technologies like React and Vite.

<p>Before diving into the world of coding, I gained extensive experience working in various roles across the airline and transportation industries. I started my career at Lufthansa Airlines, where I worked my way up from customer service to head of the Lost and Found department, eventually becoming a supervisor and coordinator. My time at Lufthansa taught me the importance of meticulous attention to detail and exceptional customer service.</p>

<p>I then transitioned to a security role with HSS/ACTS, which further honed my problem-solving skills and ability to handle high-pressure situations. This experience paved the way for my position with the City and County of Denver, where I worked in multiple capacities including Lost and Found customer service at the airport, Ground Transportation Agent, and currently as an ASA IV for commercial and transportation.</p>

My diverse background has given me a unique perspective on user experience and a strong foundation in customer service, which I bring to my web development projects. I'm excited to leverage my skills and continue growing in this dynamic field. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you!
